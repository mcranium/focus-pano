Tools for processing macro photography images

This repository houses tools for processing macro-photographic images. The emphasis here is on effective (scripted) processing of images that form focus stacks and panorama tiles. All tools here rely on open source image processing tools and a UNIX like operating system (e.g. Linux) is assumed.

## Requirements
Python 3 [work in process]
Software + links / install help [work in process]
Shell aliases to combine the tools and reduce redundancy [work in process]

## Distributing images into directories
The main paradigm of this toolbox is that images are organized in **nested directories** which reflect the hierarchy of the images.
1. all images of one panorama are located in one directory
2. all images of a focus stack are in one directory
3. all images of a Multi Light Image Collection (MLIC) are in one directory
